# IOT_final-project

The project focuses on the SMART SECURITY SYSTEM with an intruder alert.
The owner can open/close the door from any part of the world using the Blynk app.
The owner gets notified as soon the door senses an intruder in its way and the door closes immediately. After that the owner gets an OTP on his phone that is to be entered for opening the door. 5 chances are given to open the door with a 60secs cooling time upon wrong entry.
